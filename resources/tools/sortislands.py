"""
Tool to sort islands represented by polygons in GeoJSON into coastal 3 degree worldcover tiles.

The tool makes use of the fact that coastal tiles are not included completely in a continent.
Only edges of polygons overlapping with the tile need to be considered.
The method identifies all tiles of the bounding box of each edge of the polygon of the island.
Multipolygons are handled by considering each polygon included.
An island may contribute to more than a single tile.
