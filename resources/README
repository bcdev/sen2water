This is a prototype of the Sen2Water processor distributed to partners
of the OPT-MPC Sen2Water project for interface tests. It is not the
final form of delivery and includes among others ACOLITE and POLYMER
that come with conditions for their distribution that may require a
different form of installation by end users later.

Instructions
------------

Install this package and the corresponding auxiliary package on a
Linux machine in the same folder.

cd /some/software/folder/
tar xf sen2water-0.2-20240125.tar.gz
tar xf sen2water-auxdata-0.1-20240108.tar.gz
mv sen2water-0.1/auxdata sen2water-0.2

Create a working directory on a partition with space for input,
intermediates, and output. Extract an input into this working
directory.

mkdir wd
cd wd
unzip S2A_MSIL1C_20240104T103431_N0510_R108_T32UME_20240104T123149.zip

Set the shell environment and start the processor.

. ../sen2water-0.2/bin/mys2w
sen2water.sh S2A_MSIL1C_20240104T103431_N0510_R108_T32UME_20240104T123149.SAFE

The processor will run for about 25 minutes and generate an output
NetCDF4 file preliminarily called
S2A_MSIL1C_20240104T103431_N0510_R108_T32UME_20240104T123149-s2w.nc
. This file can be inspected with the Sentinel Toolbox.

If the Copernicus 90m DEM tile for an input granule is not yet
installed in the sen2water-0.1/auxdata/ folder it will be
automatically downloaded. For this purose the auxdata folder must be
writeable by the user executing the processor.
