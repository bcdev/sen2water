2024-09-24 0.4.2 fixes after validation report (ante-meridian, C2RCC cloud risk thresholds)
2024-11-24 0.5.0 sporadic deadlock in merging step avoided, S2C tested, TGC added, SNAP deployment prepared
2024-12-06 0.6.0 version for verification
2025-03-11 0.6.1 enhancements suggested during prototype final meeting

This is the Sen2Water processor distributed to partners
of the OPT-MPC Sen2Water project for verification. This version and its
configuration has been aligned with the configurations
of the CGLOPS inland water service and the CMS coastal water service.

Compared to the services Sen2Water uses a more advanced version of
POLYMER and a more advanced configuration of it. Sen2Water uses a more
advanced version of ACOLITE and a more advanced configuration as well.
Sen2Water uses the same version of C2RCC, but the Copernicus 90m DEM
instead of GETASSE30.

Licenses of the different contributions are included in the package in
the licenses sub-folder. Hygeos has granted the distribution of POLYMER
with the stand-alone version of Sen2Water. All licenses apply.

Instructions
------------

Install this package and the corresponding auxiliary package on a
Linux machine in the same folder.

cd /some/software/folder/
chmod 755 sen2water-0.6.1-linux.run
./sen2water-0.6.1-linux.run

If the Copernicus 90m DEM tile for an input granule is not yet
installed in the sen2water-0.6.1-linux/auxdata/dem/ folder it will be
automatically downloaded. For this purpose the auxdata folder must be
writeable by the user executing the processor.

To avoid automated download of the DEM a directory with the Copernicus
DEM can be provided. It needs to be linked into sen2water-0.5/auxdata
with the correct name:

rm -r sen2water-0.6.1-linux/auxdata/dem/'Copernicus 90m Global DEM'
ln -s /path/to/Copernicus90mGlobalDEM sen2water-0.6.1-linux/auxdata/dem/'Copernicus 90m Global DEM'
#rm -r sen2water-0.6.1-linux/auxdata/'Copernicus 30m Global DEM'
#ln -s /path/to/Copernicus30mGlobalDEM sen2water-0.6.1-linux/auxdata/dem/'Copernicus 30m Global DEM'

Create a working directory on a partition with space for input,
intermediates, and output. Extract an input into this working
directory.

mkdir wd
cd wd
unzip S2A_MSIL1C_20240104T103431_N0510_R108_T32UME_20240104T123149.zip

Set the shell environment and start the processor.

. ../sen2water-0.6.1-linux/bin/mys2w
sen2water.sh S2A_MSIL1C_20240104T103431_N0510_R108_T32UME_20240104T123149.SAFE

The processor will run for about 10 minutes and generate an output file
S2A_MSIL2W_20240104T103431_N0510_R108_T32UME_????????T??????.nc . This
file can be inspected with the Sentinel Toolbox.
